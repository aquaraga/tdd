This project has some code samples that illustrate Test-Driven Development, which is an Agile XP practice that is proven to be a robust coding practice. The examples could even be unsophisticated classic college programming questions; nevertheless they provide insight into how code incrementally evolves hand-in-hand with the tests.

I won't be able to show how the code evolves, but the way the tests are ordered will give a picture of how bits and pieces of code get added to achieve additional functionality.


Disclaimer: Some examples are algorithmic and task-oriented in nature (for example, the word reversal within a string), and hence not shiny examples of object-orientation.
